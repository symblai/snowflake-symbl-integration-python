So, um, I think we need to talk about the proposal? \n\nRobert Parker: Right, right. The proposal. \n\nJane Smith: You mentioned that you wanted a revised version... correct?\n\nRobert Parker: Yeah, we had some points we needed you to address. Did you...uh, get my email?\n\nJane Smith: Um, I think so... let me check. Hold on.\n\nRobert Parker: Sure...\n\nJane Smith: Okay, I found it. So, you wanted changes in, like, the pricing or something?\n\nRobert Parker: Not exactly. We had specific concerns about the integration part of the project.\n\nJane Smith: Oh, right. Integration. Do you have, like, specifics?\n\nRobert Parker: Yeah, I outlined them in the email. I think there were points about the API compatibility and data migration.\n\nJane Smith: Okay, I see... So, you need more details on, um, API and migration... Got it.\n\nRobert Parker: Yeah, and maybe a bit more clarity on the timeline as well.\n\nJane Smith: Alright. Timeline... API... Migration... Anything else?\n\nRobert Parker: Well, those are the main points. But we also wanted to discuss support options.\n\nJane Smith: Support options, sure. \n\nRobert Parker: So, what can you revise exactly?\n\nJane Smith: Uh, I'll have to check with my team on that. But, um, we can definitely work on those concerns.\n\nRobert Parker: Okay, when can you get back to us with the revised proposal?\n\nJane Smith: Um, I'll have to see. Maybe by the end of the week?\n\nRobert Parker: End of the week? Hmm... Anything faster?\n\nJane Smith: Uh, I'll try, but no promises...\n\nRobert Parker: Alright, I guess. Just prioritize the integration part, okay?\n\nJane Smith: Yep, sure. Integration first. Got it.\n\nRobert Parker: Okay, good. And the costs, too. We want to make sure there are no hidden fees.\n\nJane Smith: Right. No hidden fees. Uh, clear pricing.\n\nRobert Parker: Yes.\n\nJane Smith: So is there anything else, or should we...?\n\nRobert Parker: Just make sure you read through the entire email again, okay?\n\nJane Smith: Okay, sure. I'll read it.\n\nRobert Parker: Alright. And you'll get back to us by?\n\nJane Smith: Well, I'll say end of the week but I'll try for sooner.\n\nRobert Parker: Okay. I'll look out for it.\n\nJane Smith: Alright. Thanks, Robert.\n\nRobert Parker: Yep. Bye.\n\nJane Smith: Bye.",
