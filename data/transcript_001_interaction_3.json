Um, so, I... I wanted to talk about, um, setting up an in-person demonstration for our data warehouse, uh, capabilities.\n\nAlice Johnson: Oh, yeah. Uh, right. The demonstration.\n\nJay Mishra: Yeah, so, um, do you have a... a date in mind?\n\nAlice Johnson: Um, well... I'm not sure. Our schedule is pretty packed this month.\n\nJay Mishra: Oh, uh, okay. Um, what about next month?\n\nAlice Johnson: Possibly. Let me see... Uh, maybe, like, the second week?\n\nJay Mishra: Uh, yeah, yeah. That... that sounds good, I guess.\n\nAlice Johnson: Okay, so... like, the 10th?\n\nJay Mishra: Yeah, the 10th is, um, fine. Uh, what time works for you?\n\nAlice Johnson: Um, maybe morning? Like, 10 AM?\n\nJay Mishra: Yeah, sure. 10 AM is fine. So, um, what, uh, specifically are you looking to see in the demo?\n\nAlice Johnson: Uh... well, I guess just, you know, how your data warehouse works.\n\nJay Mishra: Right, right. So, um, like, the features? Or, um, something else?\n\nAlice Johnson: Yeah, the features. And maybe some use cases.\n\nJay Mishra: Okay, use cases. Sure. Uh, do you have any, um, specific use cases in mind?\n\nAlice Johnson: Um, I'm not really sure. Maybe something in, like, data integration?\n\nJay Mishra: Data integration, okay. Um, I can... I can prepare something for that.\n\nAlice Johnson: Great. And, um, you said in-person, right? Where are you located?\n\nJay Mishra: Uh, we're in, um, New York. Where are you based?\n\nAlice Johnson: We're in Chicago.\n\nJay Mishra: Oh, okay. Uh, that's... that's a bit of a, um, distance.\n\nAlice Johnson: Yeah, it is. Can you still come down here?\n\nJay Mishra: Uh, yeah, I guess. I mean, I'll have to check with my manager.\n\nAlice Johnson: Alright, just let me know then.\n\nJay Mishra: Sure, um, I'll... I'll do that. Uh, do you have any other questions about the demo?\n\nAlice Johnson: Not really. I mean, I don't think so.\n\nJay Mishra: Okay, uh, cool. Um, I'll email you... um, some details.\n\nAlice Johnson: Alright, sounds good.\n\nJay Mishra: Good, good. Um, so, anything else?\n\nAlice Johnson: No, I think that's it for now.\n\nJay Mishra: Okay, great, um, I'll... I'll talk to you soon then.\n\nAlice Johnson: Sure, thanks, Jay.\n\nJay Mishra: Thank you, Alice. Bye.\n\nAlice Johnson: Bye.",
