    "transcript": "Nathan Green: Hi Rebecca, it's Nathan Green from InfiniMeld. How are you doing today?\n\nRebecca Moore: Hi Nathan. I'm good. Thanks for calling. How about you?\n\nNathan Green: I'm doing well, thanks. So, uh, we're here to talk about the technical stuff and, um, integration... options... or something.\n\nRebecca Moore: Yes, uh, integration options, right. So, can you tell me more about your, uh, technical specifications?\n\nNathan Green: Sure, uh, we have, you know, a robust data warehouse. It's pretty solid, uh, fast too.\n\nRebecca Moore: Okay. Can you elaborate on, uh, the \"solid and fast\" part?\n\nNathan Green: Yeah, um, it's like, you know, it handles data really well. Fast access and everything.\n\nRebecca Moore: Right, but we need something specific, like, um, the analytics part. How does it handle that?\n\nNathan Green: Analytics, yes. We have analytics. It's integrated, I think.\n\nRebecca Moore: Integrated analytics is good but what kind of, um, tools or integrations do you support?\n\nNathan Green: Tools, of course, we... have tools. Do you use Excel? We can do Excel.\n\nRebecca Moore: Yes, but we primarily use Tableau. Does it support Tableau?\n\nNathan Green: Absolutely, uh, Tables. I mean, Tableau, yes. It should support that.\n\nRebecca Moore: Should support? I need something more definitive here.\n\nNathan Green: Umm, let me think... yes, it does. I think. Yeah, it does.\n\nRebecca Moore: Alright. Can you, uh, tell me about the process of integration with Tableau?\n\nNathan Green: Umm, you probably have to install something. A connector or something like that. It should be simple.\n\nRebecca Moore: Hmm. What about data import? How does your system handle that?\n\nNathan Green: Import, yes. We handle it. You have data, it gets imported. Pretty straightforward.\n\nRebecca Moore: And, uh, automation. Do you support automation in data import?\n\nNathan Green: Yes, definitely. Automation is key. We support it, for sure.\n\nRebecca Moore: What kind of automation workflows do you provide?\n\nNathan Green: Automation workflows... um, the good ones. Like, timely updates and stuff.\n\nRebecca Moore: Can I customize those workflows?\n\nNathan Green: Custom, yes. Flexibility is our thing. You can set things the way you like them.\n\nRebecca Moore: Okay, that's a bit vague. Can you give an example?\n\nNathan Green: Example... let's say you need a report every day. You can set it to automatically, uh, refresh.\n\nRebecca Moore: And the security aspects? Data security is very crucial for us.\n\nNathan Green: Yeah, security. We have that covered. Firewalls and encrypted stuff, you know.\n\nRebecca Moore: Can you specify the encryption standards you use?\n\nNathan Green: Standards, yes. We use those. The standard ones, uh, AES maybe?\n\nRebecca Moore: You don't sound very sure. Is it AES or something else?\n\nNathan Green: I think it's AES. But we can check that.\n\nRebecca Moore: Moving on, uh, what are the integration options with existing cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud?\n\nNathan Green: AWS and Google, right. We work with those. There's some integration with APIs.\n\nRebecca Moore: Can you specify which APIs you support?\n\nNathan Green: Specific APIs? Uhhh, the common ones. RESTful, maybe?\n\nRebecca Moore: Maybe isn't clear enough. Can you provide documentation?\n\nNathan Green: Documentation, right. We have that. It's put somewhere, I'll need to find it.\n\nRebecca Moore: We need this to make an informed decision. What about support?\n\nNathan Green: Support, we have. Our team is pretty good, I think.\n\nRebecca Moore: Is it 24/7 support?\n\nNathan Green: Uhh, not sure. But we have email support. And maybe phone too? I'll confirm.\n\nRebecca Moore: We need 24/7 support, Nathan. Can you get back to me on that?\n\nNathan Green: Yes, I'll, ah, get back to you soon. Anything else you need?\n\nRebecca Moore: Yes, pricing. We need details on that.\n\nNathan Green: Pricing, right. We have packages, you know. Different prices for different things.\n\nRebecca Moore: What are the packages?\n\nNathan Green: Umm, there's a starter, advanced, and enterprise, I think. I'll need to look at the exact numbers.\n\nRebecca Moore: And SLA terms? How do those look?\n\nNathan Green: SLA terms. Hmm. We have SLAs. I'll, uh, need to find them too. \n\nRebecca Moore: You seem unsure about a lot of these things, Nathan. Can you send me detailed info?\n\nNathan Green: Yeah, I can do that. Give me some time, and I'll compile everything and send it over. \n\nRebecca Moore: Alright. I expected more clarity, but I'll look at what you send. \n\nNathan Green: Okay, um, anything else right now?\n\nRebecca Moore: Not at the moment. Let's follow up once I get the details.\n\nNathan Green: Sure, I'll be in touch. Thanks, Rebecca. \n\nRebecca Moore: Thank you, Nathan. Goodbye.\n\nNathan Green: Goodbye.",
