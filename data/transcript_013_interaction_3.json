So, um, we had the online demo the other day. \n\nEmily Stone: Yes, we did. It was...interesting.\n\nMark Thompson: Yeah, interesting. Did you, uh, have any questions about it?\n\nEmily Stone: Um, I think some parts were a bit unclear about how the integration actually works.\n\nMark Thompson: Oh, okay. Um, what parts specifically?\n\nEmily Stone: Well, the data flow, mostly. How does it connect with our existing systems?\n\nMark Thompson: Right. Uh, so we have this thing where... uh, it integrates. With the system.\n\nEmily Stone: Yes, but how exactly does it integrate? What are the steps?\n\nMark Thompson: Right. So, um, there are several steps. I think. \n\nEmily Stone: Do you have those steps documented?\n\nMark Thompson: Um, well, I\u2019m sure we do somewhere, but I can check that for you.\n\nEmily Stone: Okay, that would be helpful. \n\nMark Thompson: Sure. Anything else, maybe, about the demo?\n\nEmily Stone: Yeah, I\u2019m also wondering about the security aspects. How is data security handled?\n\nMark Thompson: Security, right. So, um, the system is secure.\n\nEmily Stone: Can you elaborate?\n\nMark Thompson: It's, uh, encrypted.\n\nEmily Stone: Okay, what kind of encryption do you use?\n\nMark Thompson: Um, the standard kind... AES, I think. Yeah, AES.\n\nEmily Stone: Hmm, okay. And what about the licensing fees?\n\nMark Thompson: Licensing, right. Um, they depend on usage.\n\nEmily Stone: Can you be more specific?\n\nMark Thompson: Well, it varies. \n\nEmily Stone: Varies how?\n\nMark Thompson: Uh, based on how much you use it, I think.\n\nEmily Stone: Okay. We\u2019d need more details on that.\n\nMark Thompson: Sure, I'll get those details to you. Anything else?\n\nEmily Stone: I'm also curious, um, about customer support.\n\nMark Thompson: Support is, uh, available.\n\nEmily Stone: Available how? Email, phone?\n\nMark Thompson: Both, I think. \n\nEmily Stone: And what are the hours?\n\nMark Thompson: It depends on the plan, I believe.\n\nEmily Stone: Okay. Can you send me that information too?\n\nMark Thompson: Yeah, absolutely. Anything else?\n\nEmily Stone: No, I think that covers it for now. \n\nMark Thompson: Great, so yeah. I'll get that info to you.\n\nEmily Stone: Okay, thanks.\n\nMark Thompson: Sure. Talk soon, Emily.\n\nEmily Stone: Talk soon, Mark. Thanks.\n\nMark Thompson: Bye.\n\nEmily Stone: Bye.",
